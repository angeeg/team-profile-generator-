## Description 
This application was created to help an employer create a Team Profile through the command line in this node.js app. Follow the prompts in the command line, and soon you will see the team profile be generated into a HTML website. 

## Installation 
1. Clone the <a href="https://github.com/angeeg/team-profile-generator-.git">github repo</a> onto your machine in the directory you want to save it in. 
2. Open the repo in your code editor. 
3. Open the terminal in your code editor and run 'npm i' then run 'npm start' to invoke the application.
## Usage 
Once you run 'npm start' in the command line, you will be prompted with questions to create a new employee. Once things are improved you will be able to see the HTMl file be generated automatically once you're done adding team members to your profile.
